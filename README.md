# **SOUNDSCAPE NARRATIVE PROJECT**

## *Title:* Ringing the Bell

This narrative's goal is to portray what it would be like for a family to find out their child has been diagnosed with cancer, and all of the ins and outs of that process. I want to focus on the emotions surrounding this entire process and will attempt to really elicit that sympathetic and sad reaction from the audience. The idea came from my conenction with The Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. I am heavily involved with Pitt Dance Marathon, and have developed a very good relationship with some of the families with children that have been in this hospital since they were born. I am constantly being inspired by their resilience and care with their children, and want to give a little insight into what this experience is like for families.

I will be recording all of the conversations that go on in this narrative, as well as some every day noises like a car starting and a phone ringing. I will be sourcing from free audio file sites, and just using my phone, headphones, and laptop mics to record.

Most of the sourced files will come from freesound.org.
