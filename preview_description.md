In this preview, I am showing the opening of my audio narrative.  It features a human heartbeat, a child coughing, and the 
beginning of a phone call. The rest of the sounds are files that will be used later in the narrative, such as the sounds 
coming from the hospital waiting room and doctor's offices. This narrative's goal is to portray what it would be like for a 
family to find out their child has been diagnosed with cancer, and all of the ins and outs of that process.I want to focus 
on the emotions surrounding this entire process and will attempt to really elicit that sympathetic and sad reaction from the 
audience. The idea came from my conenction with The Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. I am heavily involved with Pitt Dance 
Marathon, and have developed a very good relationship with some of the families with children that have been in this hospital 
since they were born.  I am constantly being inspired by their resilience and care with their children, and want to give a 
little insight into what this experience is like for families.

The layout of this file is going to be the initial doctor's visit, a phone call receiving the bad news, crying, driving to and 
from the doctor's office every day, some repetitive sounds like a hospital waiting room, conversations with a doctor, the 
child asking the mom questions, therapy in between that (hopefully with a therapy dog), a final surgery, and then at the end, 
the child will have the chance to ring the bell to celebrate being cancer-free. The goal is to mainly elicit sad emotions 
the whole time, and then quickly switch gears at the end to a very exciting moment for the whole family.

Current questions I have are:
How am I going to portray these conversations?
Am I going to have to ask people to take part, or can I genuinely use nuances to insinuate these conversations took place?
How can I incorporate my own sounds into this piece?
