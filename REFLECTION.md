#### *This is just a description of the final piece and some comments I have about my piece.*

This final piece shows the battle a family faces when a child finds out they have a life-threatening illness like cancer. 
As I said before,  want to focus on the emotions surrounding this entire process and will attempt to really elicit that 
sympathetic and sad reaction from the audience. The idea came from my conenction with The Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. 
I have been given the incredible opportunity to meet and develop very good relationships with some of the families with 
children that have been in this hospital since they were born. I am constantly being inspired by their resilience and care 
with their children, and want to give a little insight into what this experience is like for families. 

This piece is my tribute to them.

This project layout changed, because I wanted to show that these families go through a very similar process almost daily, with
doctor's appointments, trips to the hospital, surgeries, and treatments.  I decided to title the piece *Ringing the Bell* as a
foreshadowing of the very end where the patient gets to ring the cancer free bell.

I think I have some editing to do on this, including transitions between sounds, tempos of certain files, and possibly the 
general editing of the entire file. I think considering this is my first time using Audacity, I did a pretty decent job, but 
could definitely use extra practice. Overall, though, I am proud of how this project turned out.
